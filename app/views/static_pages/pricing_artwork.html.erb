  <h3>Art Requirements</h3>

  <p>
	Having a great digital file will translate to the best prints. If artwork meets these requirements you will have the best product and fastest turn around.<br />
	<br />
	<h5>File Formats:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Illustrator (.ai) files, all artwork turned to outlines.</li>
		<li>Photoshop (.psd) files, all artwork rasterized with layers intact.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Artwork should be set to the size you want printed. Resolution should be 300 dpi. Check our <%= link_to 'Services', '/services'%> for size requirements.<br>
		Colors must be separated on their own layer. Digital colors and ink colors may not always match perfectly.<br />
		You can <%= link_to "Contact", "mailto:alchemistprintingcompany@gmail.com" %> us with any questions about your art files. <br />
		Designs that do not meet these criteria may be returned for reformatting. Designs returned for reformatting may delay the timeline of finished work.
